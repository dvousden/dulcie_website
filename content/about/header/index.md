  Hello! I'm Dulcie.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a former neuroscientist who transitioned from academic research into data science. I am currently the Data Science Lead at DataKind UK where I help social change organisations turn their challenges into data science problems. I like beautiful data visualisations, reproducible analysis, and statistics. My goal is to make data science more approachable, understandable, and accessible.
